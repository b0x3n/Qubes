# How to play

Kinda hard to explain - this was a __pseudo-3D__ Tetris style game.

We have a sort of __3D cube__ (it's really just 7 layers stacked on top of one another). 

A shape made up of a number of cubes will appear towards the __bottom__ of the cube, the shape will be made up of one, two or 3 cubes in a specific configuration.

Initially, this shape will be _red_ in color, after a second it'll turn _amber_ then after another second it'll turn _green_ and __'lock'__ into place. Before the shape locks we can move it either _up_, _down_, _left_ or _right_ to position it, but we __cannot__ _rotate_ the shape!

Once the shape has 'locked' it will begin to rise towards the __top__ of the cube where it will finally land and rest on the top layer, you can press the _down_ arrow key to cause the shape to move up quicker.

The main object is to connect 7 cubes in a row either _horizontally_ or _vertically_, if we get 7 cubes in a row that line will disappear and we'll get some points.

If any of the cubes that make up the shape _clashes_ with any of the cubes already landed on the top layer then those cubes are _annihilated_ and you __lose one of your lives__.

Remember - you _can't rotate the shapes_ before they lock, you can only move them _up_, _down_, _left_ or _right_ - however, you can _rotate the top layer of the cube_ __only__ _once the shape has locked into place and begins to rise towards the top of the cube_ - simply use the _left_ and _right_ arrow keys to rotate the top layer of the cube as the shape rises.

This means each time a new shape appears you have __3 seconds__ to consider where to position the shape and also how you intend to rotate the top layer of the cube to avoid clashes and connect the cubes and annihilate lines.

Honestly - it's not that complicated and my explaination of how to play probably makes it more confusing, it's fairly intuitive after a few minutes of playing around, actually kinda fun!
